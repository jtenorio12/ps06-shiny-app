Our dataset contains data that covers each individual category of assigning a homeless status to individuals within Washington State. In my R Studio Shiny, I have created three tabs which are my Introduction, Data Plot, and Display Table. Within my Introduction, I used data conducted by All Home (lead agency) for Seattle/King County Continuum of Care, specifically focused on the duration of homelessness which displays the percent and count of individuals falling under each category. Further, within my Data Plot, I used Census focusing on the causes of homelessness, where the widget allows you to change the type of color, and click on the each causes. There, the data will create bar graphs for each year based on the count for each cause as well. Finally, in my Display Table the data contains a widget that allows you to change the type of Region within Washington State that are affected by homelessness. In addition, containing information around those who were sheltered and those who aren't.
